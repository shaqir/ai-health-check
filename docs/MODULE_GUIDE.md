## Module 1: Service Registry & Connection

**Owner:** Jack

### What It Does

- Provides a CRUD catalog of registered AI services (name, owner, endpoint, environment, model, sensitivity label)
- Runs scheduled health checks every 5 minutes via APScheduler using HTTP probes (no LLM API consumption)
- Supports on-demand connection testing in two modes: HTTP endpoint probe or Claude API health check
- Records all connection results in `ConnectionLog` for latency tracking and dashboard metrics

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/routers/services.py` | 6 endpoints: service CRUD + connection testing |
| `backend/app/main.py` | APScheduler setup, `scheduled_health_check()` function |
| `backend/app/models/__init__.py` | `AIService`, `ConnectionLog`, `Environment`, `SensitivityLabel` models |
| `backend/app/services/llm_client.py` | `test_connection()` -- used for LLM-mode connection testing |
| `backend/app/services/url_validator.py` | SSRF guard: blocks metadata service, RFC1918, link-local, non-http schemes on endpoint_url |
| `backend/app/services/sensitivity.py` | `enforce_sensitivity()` blocks LLM calls for confidential services unless admin overrides |
| `frontend/src/pages/ServicesPage.jsx` | Service registry UI with CRUD forms, test connection button, confidential override confirm dialog |

### API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/services` | List all services |
| GET | `/api/v1/services/{id}` | Get single service |
| POST | `/api/v1/services` | Create service (admin/maintainer) |
| PUT | `/api/v1/services/{id}` | Update service (admin/maintainer) |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/services/{id}` | Delete service (admin/maintainer) |
| POST | `/api/v1/services/{id}/test-connection` | Test connection (mode=http or mode=llm) |

### Database Models

- `AIService` -- service registry with environment enum (prod/staging/dev) and sensitivity label (public/internal/confidential)
- `ConnectionLog` -- stores latency_ms, status, response_snippet per check

### Stretch Goals Achieved

- Dual connection testing modes (HTTP probe + LLM health check)
- Sensitivity label classification on each service **with enforcement** — confidential services require admin override to reach the LLM; every override audited
- Automatic health check scheduling (configurable interval)
- SSRF guard — blocks registration/update/probe/scheduled tick from hitting metadata services, private IPs, or non-http schemes

---

## Module 2: Monitoring Dashboard & Evaluation

**Owner:** Sakir

### What It Does

- Aggregates fleet-wide metrics: active service count, average latency, error rate, average quality score
- Computes P50/P95/P99 latency percentiles from connection logs and API usage data
- Runs evaluation harness: executes test cases against Claude, scores responses (factuality via LLM-as-judge, format via JSON parse), and runs hallucination detection on factuality cases
- Detects model drift with severity classification (none/warning/critical), trend analysis (improving/declining/stable), and confidence scoring
- Provides per-test-case drift breakdown with historical score tracking
- Generates AI-powered dashboard insights summarizing platform health
- Traces LLM calls with full prompt/response storage for auditability
- Aggregates cost-by-service for monthly spend analysis
- Manages alerts auto-created on drift, with acknowledge workflow

## Module 3: Incident Triage & Maintenance Planner

**Owner:** Osele

### What It Does

- Manages the full incident lifecycle: open, investigate, resolved, closed
- Captures troubleshooting checklist (data issue, prompt change, model update, infrastructure, safety/policy)
- Generates LLM-assisted stakeholder updates and root cause analysis via Claude
- Enforces human-in-the-loop approval: AI drafts go to `summary_draft`, must be explicitly approved before becoming the official `summary`. Approval requires a `reviewer_note` (≥20 non-whitespace chars) so the reviewer cannot silently rubber-stamp a draft. Double-approval returns 409 — attribution is preserved
- Creates maintenance plans linked to incidents with rollback procedures and admin approval

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/routers/incidents.py` | 4 endpoints: incident CRUD, LLM summary generation, approval |
| `backend/app/routers/maintenance.py` | 3 endpoints: maintenance plan CRUD, admin approval |
| `backend/app/services/llm_client.py` | `generate_summary()` -- drafts stakeholder update + root causes |
| `backend/app/models/__init__.py` | `Incident`, `IncidentStatus`, `Severity`, `MaintenancePlan` models |
| `frontend/src/pages/IncidentsPage.jsx` | Incident listing with severity/status filtering |
| `frontend/src/pages/IncidentDetailPage.jsx` | Individual incident deep-dive with summary generation and approval |

### API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/incidents` | List all incidents |
| POST | `/api/v1/incidents` | Create incident (admin/maintainer) |
| POST | `/api/v1/incidents/{id}/generate-summary` | Generate LLM draft summary (admin/maintainer) |
| POST | `/api/v1/incidents/{id}/approve-summary` | Approve draft and publish (admin/maintainer) |
| GET | `/api/v1/maintenance` | List all maintenance plans |
| POST | `/api/v1/maintenance` | Create maintenance plan (admin/maintainer) |
| PUT | `/api/v1/maintenance/{id}/approve` | Approve maintenance plan (admin only) |

### Database Models

- `Incident` -- severity (low/medium/high/critical), status (open/investigating/resolved/closed), symptoms, checklist booleans, summary_draft, summary (approved), root_causes, approved_by, approved_at, reviewer_note (mandatory ≥20 chars)
- `MaintenancePlan` -- linked to incident, risk_level, rollback_plan, validation_steps, scheduled_date, approved flag

### Stretch Goals Achieved

- Full troubleshooting checklist integrated into LLM prompt for better root cause analysis
- Human-in-the-loop approval flow (draft -> review -> publish) with mandatory reviewer note and idempotency guard
- Maintenance plan approval restricted to admin role

## Module 4: Governance, Security & Compliance

**Owner:** Jeewanjot

### What It Does

- Automatically logs every state-changing operation (POST/PUT/DELETE) to an immutable audit trail
- Provides filtered audit log queries with date range and action type filters
- Supports compliance data export in JSON and PDF formats
- Generates AI-powered compliance reports from audit logs, incidents, and drift data
- Manages user roles (admin-only user role updates with self-modification prevention)

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/routers/users.py` | User list + role update (admin only) — mounted under `/api/v1/compliance` |
| `backend/app/routers/audit.py` | Audit log queries + hash-chain integrity verify (admin only) |
| `backend/app/routers/export.py` | JSON/PDF export with audit + incidents + maintenance, AI compliance report (HITL draft/approve) |
| `backend/app/services/draft_service.py` | Shared HITL abstraction: `create_draft()` / `approve_draft()` |
| `backend/app/middleware/audit.py` | `log_action()` with SHA-256 hash chain + `verify_audit_chain()`, serialised under `_AUDIT_LOCK` |
| `backend/app/middleware/rbac.py` | `require_role()` -- role-based access enforcement |
| `backend/app/middleware/auth.py` | JWT verification, bcrypt hashing, login throttling |
| `backend/app/services/llm_client.py` | `generate_compliance_summary()` -- AI governance report |
| `backend/app/models/__init__.py` | `AuditLog`, `User`, `UserRole`, `LoginAttempt` models |
| `frontend/src/pages/GovernancePage.jsx` | Audit log viewer, compliance report generation |

| GET | `/api/v1/compliance/ai-report/recent` | List approved / all drafts (admin only) |

### Database Models

- `AuditLog` -- append-only tamper-evident log: user_id, action, target_table, target_id, old_value, new_value, timestamp, `content_hash`, `prev_hash`. SQLite BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE triggers reject mutation
- `AILlmDraft` -- shared HITL envelope for dashboard insights + compliance reports: surface, content, generated_by_user_id, approved_by_user_id, approved_at
- `User` -- identity with role enum (admin/maintainer/viewer), bcrypt password hash
- `LoginAttempt` -- email, timestamp, IP address, success boolean. Success/failure/lockout also written to AuditLog
- `Alert` -- governance-relevant alerting: type, severity, message, service_id, acknowledged. Auto-created on drift; managed via dashboard endpoints (see [Module 2](#module-2-monitoring-dashboard--evaluation))

### Stretch Goals Achieved

- PDF export using ReportLab with styled table output AND explicit truncation warnings in red
- JSON/PDF export includes audit + incidents + maintenance plans (not just audit records)
- Strict date parsing on all date-filtered endpoints (400 on malformed, 400 on inverted range) — no silent compliance evidence holes
- AI-generated compliance reports with HITL draft/approve flow
- Tamper-evident audit chain (SHA-256 hash chain) with integrity verify endpoint
- Self-modification prevention on role changes
- Role-denial events (`role_denied`) written to audit log for forensic review

## Cross-Cutting Features

These features span multiple modules and are not owned by a single team member.

### Prompt Safety Scanner

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/services/safety.py` | Input and output scanning |

- 15 regex patterns for injection detection (role overrides, delimiter exploitation, system prompt extraction)
- PII detection for email, phone, SSN, credit card
- Toxicity checks via `scan_output()` toxicity_patterns: violence, bias, and illegal content filtering
- Prompt length enforcement (max 10,000 characters)
- Risk scoring 0-100; score >= 80 blocks the prompt
- Output scanning for PII leakage, toxicity, and model refusal patterns
- Raises `PromptSafetyError` (HTTP 422) when thresholds exceeded

### API Budget Enforcement (concurrency-safe)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/services/llm_client.py` | `_check_budget()` + atomic reservation under `_BUDGET_LOCK` |

- Daily cap: $5.00, monthly cap: $25.00 (tracked via `APIUsageLog`)
- Per-call cost tracking with token usage logging (input + output)
- Global rate limit: 10 calls/min, per-user: 5 calls/min
- Raises `BudgetExceededError` (HTTP 402 for budget, HTTP 429 for rate limits)
- Lock + reservation pattern prevents N concurrent callers from all racing past the limit. Reservation INSERT happens under the lock; actual API call runs outside so slow requests don't block the pool

### Tamper-evident Audit Chain

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/middleware/audit.py` | `log_action()` with SHA-256 hash chain, `verify_audit_chain()`, serialised by `_AUDIT_LOCK` |
| `backend/app/main.py` | Installs SQLite BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE triggers on `audit_log` at startup |
| `backend/app/routers/audit.py` | Admin-only `/audit-log/verify` endpoint walks the chain |

- Every audit row commits SHA-256 over row content + previous row's hash
- Any UPDATE or DELETE on a past row breaks the chain — detectable via verify endpoint
- DB triggers reject app-path mutation as defence in depth
- `threading.Lock` around read-compute-insert so concurrent writes produce distinct prev_hashes

### SSRF Guard

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/services/url_validator.py` | `validate_outbound_url()` |

- Rejects non-http schemes (file://, gopher://, etc.) and hostnames resolving to loopback, RFC1918, link-local (AWS metadata 169.254.169.254), multicast, reserved
- Called at service register, update, probe, and the scheduled health-check tick
- Mixed public/private DNS resolution fails the whole URL (defeats DNS rebinding)

### Shared HITL Draft Service

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/services/draft_service.py` | `create_draft()` + `approve_draft()` |

- Any LLM output meant for governance-grade consumption routes through this service
- Persists as unapproved `AILlmDraft` row; separate approve endpoint sets `approved_by_user_id` + `approved_at`
- Create AND approve are both audited
- Used by dashboard insights and compliance AI reports; incident summaries use their own columns on the Incident row (same pattern)

### Login Throttling

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/routers/auth.py` | `_check_login_throttle()`, `_record_login_attempt()` |

- Records all login attempts with email, IP, timestamp
- 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes triggers lockout
- Lockout returns HTTP 429

### LLM Call Tracing

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/services/llm_client.py` | Stores `prompt_text` and `response_text` (2000 char max) in `APIUsageLog` on every call |
| `backend/app/routers/dashboard.py` | `GET /api-calls/{id}` returns full trace; `GET /cost-by-service` aggregates monthly cost per service |

- Every LLM call records the prompt sent and response received in `APIUsageLog.prompt_text` / `APIUsageLog.response_text`
- `APIUsageLog.service_id` links each call to the originating AI service for per-service cost analysis
- Full trace retrievable via `GET /api/v1/dashboard/api-calls/{id}`
- Inspired by LangSmith/Helicone tracing patterns

### Alert System

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/models/__init__.py` | `Alert` model: type, severity, message, service_id, acknowledged |
| `backend/app/routers/dashboard.py` | `GET /alerts`, `POST /alerts/{id}/acknowledge` |

- Alerts are auto-created when drift detection flags a service
- Each alert has a severity level and links to the affected AI service
- Dashboard displays active alerts with an Acknowledge button
- Acknowledged alerts are retained for audit trail but filtered from active view
- Inspired by Datadog/PagerDuty alerting patterns

### Design System & Accessibility

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `frontend/src/index.css` | CSS variable design tokens, theme definitions |
| `frontend/src/components/common/ThemeProvider.jsx` | Dark/light mode toggle |
| `frontend/src/components/common/CommandPalette.jsx` | Cmd+K navigation |
| `frontend/src/components/common/Modal.jsx` | Accessible dialog with focus trap |

- WCAG 2.2 AA: ARIA roles, focus traps, screen reader support, skip-to-main link
- Inter (body) + JetBrains Mono (code) font pairing
- Full keyboard navigation: Cmd+K palette, G+D/S/I/E shortcuts, Escape to close

### Flow Summary

Monitor (M2) -> Detect drift (M2) -> Create incident (M3) -> Generate AI summary (M3) -> Approve draft (M3) -> Plan maintenance (M3) -> Approve plan (M3) -> View audit trail (M4) -> Generate compliance report (M4) -> Export evidence (M4)

Every step is recorded in the audit log automatically. The safety scanner and budget enforcement run on every LLM call (steps 6, 9, 14).
