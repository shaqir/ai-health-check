### R1: PII Leakage

Sensitive data sent to or returned from the cloud LLM.

- `scan_input()` in `safety.py` detects email, phone, SSN, and credit card via compiled regex before any prompt reaches Claude
- `scan_output()` in `safety.py` flags PII in responses; blocks those containing SSN or credit card (`safe` returns false)
- All outbound API calls routed through `llm_client.py` -- no route handler touches the Anthropic SDK
- `sanitize_text()` in `safety.py` strips control characters and HTML-encodes angle brackets

Residual: PII in formats not matching the four regex patterns will pass through undetected.

---

### R2: Model Drift

Anthropic updates Claude and response quality degrades silently.

- Eval harness produces quality scores (0-100); drift threshold at 75% triggers flag
- Per-test tracking via `EvalResult` model stores score, latency, and response per test case per run
- Drift severity (none/warning/critical) and trend analysis documented in [EVAL_DATASET_CARD.md](EVAL_DATASET_CARD.md)
- APScheduler runs evaluations on a configurable recurring schedule
- Auto-alert creation via the `Alert` model when drift is detected (alert_type, severity, message, service_id); alerts can be acknowledged via `POST /alerts/{id}/acknowledge`

Residual: Small test dataset (2 cases per service) may miss category-specific degradation.

---

### R3: Hallucination

Claude generates plausible but incorrect root causes or summaries.

- LLM output stored in `summary_draft` holding field; requires explicit approval via `approved_by`
- `score_factuality()` in `llm_client.py` rates factual similarity 0-100 during eval runs (see [PROMPT_CHANGE_LOG.md](PROMPT_CHANGE_LOG.md) for prompt template)
- `detect_hallucination()` in `llm_client.py` scores unsupported or fabricated claims 0-100 (0 = no hallucination, 100 = severe); result stored in `EvalRun.hallucination_score` (see [PROMPT_CHANGE_LOG.md](PROMPT_CHANGE_LOG.md) for prompt template)

Residual: Human reviewer may lack domain knowledge to catch subtle inaccuracies.

---

### R4: Evaluation Bias

Claude consistently favors certain root causes or phrases recommendations in biased ways.

- Human review of every LLM suggestion before it enters the incident record
- Per-test-case breakdown in drift-check endpoint shows individual performance and trends
- Eval test cases span multiple categories (factuality, format_json) per [EVAL_DATASET_CARD.md](EVAL_DATASET_CARD.md)

Residual: All test cases are English-only and synthetically generated.

---

### R5: Service Outage

Anthropic API goes down or rate limits are hit during operations.

- `_make_api_call()` in `llm_client.py` retries with exponential backoff: `2^attempt + random(0, 0.5)` sec, max 2 retries for `RateLimitError`, `APIConnectionError`, `InternalServerError`
- `test_connection()` in `llm_client.py` verifies API availability (max_tokens=50, catches all exceptions)
- Incident workflow (create, triage, checklist) operates fully without the LLM

Residual: Extended Anthropic outages (>2h) block summary generation and evaluations.

---

### R6: Cost Overrun

Automated evaluations or heavy usage exceeds budget.

- `_check_budget()` in `llm_client.py` enforces daily ($5) and monthly ($25) limits before every call
- Per-call cost estimation using `_estimate_cost()` at Sonnet 4.6 pricing ($3/M input, $15/M output)
- Every call logged to `api_usage_log` with `estimated_cost_usd`; `BudgetExceededError` raised at HTTP 402
- Rate limits: 10 calls/min global, 5 calls/min per-user

Residual: Token-based estimation is approximate; actual Anthropic billing may differ.

---

### R7: Brute-Force

Attacker gains access by repeatedly guessing passwords.

- `LoginAttempt` model records every attempt with email, IP, and timestamp
- After 5 failures within 15 minutes for the same email, HTTP 429 blocks further attempts
- Throttle check runs before password verification, preventing timing-based information leakage

Residual: Only email-based throttling; no IP-based rate limiting at the application level.

---

### R8: Prompt Injection

Malicious input manipulates Claude or extracts internal instructions.

- `scan_input()` in `safety.py` checks 15 compiled regex patterns (instruction override, role manipulation, system prompt extraction, known exploits)
- Risk scoring: 40 pts per injection match, 20 per PII type, 15 for length warning (>80% of 10k char max), 100 for length exceeded
- Block threshold: risk >= 80; raises `PromptSafetyError` (HTTP 422); logged as `blocked_safety`
- `scan_output()` detects model refusal patterns in Claude responses

Residual: Regex-based detection cannot catch novel or obfuscated injection techniques.

---

### R9: Audit Log Tampering

An insider or intruder modifies or deletes past audit rows to hide activity.

- Every audit row commits a SHA-256 `content_hash` computed over its content plus the previous row's hash (`middleware/audit.py`) — a modified row breaks the chain and is detectable by replaying it.
- SQLite `BEFORE UPDATE` and `BEFORE DELETE` triggers on `audit_log` reject mutations from the application path (`main.py:_install_audit_log_triggers`).
- `GET /compliance/audit-log/verify` (admin-only) walks the chain and reports `{total, valid, broken_at, reason}`. Surfaced in the Governance UI as "Verify integrity."
- Role-denied attempts on sensitive endpoints are themselves audited (`role_denied` action) so probing is visible to reviewers.

Residual: Production should use Postgres row permissions or a WORM-enforced audit service. The SQLite triggers can be bypassed by a direct DB connection, but the hash chain still detects the resulting tamper on next verify.

---

### R10: Confidential Data Leakage via LLM

A service labelled `confidential` reaches the external LLM without explicit governance sign-off.

- `app/services/sensitivity.py:enforce_sensitivity()` gates every LLM call tied to a service (test-connection, eval run, incident summary).
- `confidential` services are blocked unless the caller passes `allow_confidential=true` AND holds the admin role. Non-admins are rejected even with the flag.
- Every attempt (allowed or denied) writes to the audit log (`confidential_llm_override` / `confidential_llm_blocked`).
- Frontend shows a confirm dialog before admins can override.

Residual: The `public` / `internal` labels do not trigger any additional controls. Misclassification of a confidential service as internal is undetected.

---

### R11: Unapproved LLM Output Treated as Official

LLM-generated content is consumed as authoritative without human review.

- Incident summaries: written to `Incident.summary_draft`. Published as `Incident.summary` only via explicit `POST /incidents/{id}/approve-summary` which records `approved_by`.
- Maintenance plans: `approved` defaults `False`. Flipped by `POST /maintenance/{id}/approve`.
- Dashboard insights + compliance AI reports: persisted as unapproved `AILlmDraft` rows by the shared `draft_service`. Separate approve endpoint flips `approved_by_user_id` and writes `llm_draft_approved` to the audit log.
- Compliance export excludes unapproved incident summaries — drafts never appear in the official record.

Residual: Humans approving without reading the content are still the weak link. Mitigated by presenting the full draft in the UI alongside the Approve button.

---

### R12: Privileged Data Read by Viewer Role

Viewer token can query governance-grade endpoints intended for admins.

- `GET /compliance/audit-log` is `require_role(["admin"])` (as is `/audit-log/verify`, `/users`, `/users/{id}/role`, and the AI compliance report endpoints).
- `require_role` middleware (`middleware/rbac.py`) writes a `role_denied` row to the audit log for every 403 so probing is traceable.
- Frontend conditionally omits the audit-log fetch for non-admins to avoid misleading "failed to load" errors.

Residual: Generic list endpoints (e.g. `/services`, `/incidents`) are authenticated but not role-scoped by design — any logged-in user can read operational state. This is consistent with the spec's Viewer = "read-only" role.

---

### R13: SSRF via Service endpoint_url

A user registers a service with an `endpoint_url` pointing at an internal address (AWS metadata service, loopback, RFC1918, link-local) and exfiltrates data via `Ping` or the scheduled health check's `response_snippet`.

- `app/services/url_validator.py::validate_outbound_url()` rejects non-http(s) schemes and any hostname that resolves to a loopback, RFC1918, link-local (169.254.0.0/16 includes AWS/GCP metadata), carrier-grade NAT, multicast, or reserved range — IPv4 and IPv6.
- Validation runs at service registration (POST /services), on update (PUT /services/{id}), at probe time (POST /services/{id}/test-connection) to close the DNS-rebinding window, and in the APScheduler `scheduled_health_check()` tick.
- DNS resolution checks ALL returned addresses; any blocked address fails the whole URL — defeats records that mix public and private IPs.

Residual: A public hostname that an attacker controls could still be used to exfiltrate information stored in the tenant's service registry (the endpoint_url itself). Lower severity since registration is admin/maintainer-gated.

---

### R14: Budget / Rate Limit Bypass via Concurrency

Concurrent callers race past `_check_budget()` — all observe the count below the limit simultaneously and all proceed, collectively exceeding daily budget and per-minute rate limits.

- `app/services/llm_client.py::_make_api_call()` holds `_BUDGET_LOCK` around the check AND an atomic reservation INSERT into `api_usage_log` with `status="reserved"` and a worst-case cost estimate. Subsequent callers observe the reservation row and back off.
- The actual Anthropic API call happens OUTSIDE the lock so slow calls don't block other evaluators.
- `_finalize_reservation()` updates the reserved row with real tokens/cost/status (success, error_timeout, error_rate_limit, etc.) when the API call returns.

Residual: Single-process lock only — multi-worker deployments would need Redis INCR+TTL or a DB-native advisory lock. Documented inline in `llm_client.py`.

---

### R15: Compliance Evidence Silently Incomplete

Two failure modes could produce audit-ready exports that looked correct but were missing data — a regulator then audits evidence that misrepresents the compliance window:

1. Malformed date on `/compliance/export` was silently swallowed — a typo in `from_date` returned the entire history.
2. Row cap of 500 per section was invisible — exports from multi-month windows silently dropped older rows.

- `app/routers/export.py::_parse_date_or_400()` raises HTTP 400 on malformed dates; also rejects inverted ranges (`from_date > to_date`). Same guard on `/compliance/audit-log` listing and `/compliance/ai-report`.
- `EXPORT_ROW_LIMIT` raised to 10000 per section.
- Every export returns `audit_total_in_range`, `incidents_total_in_range`, `maintenance_total_in_range`, and a `warnings` array whenever truncation occurred. PDF exports render warnings in red under the header.

Residual: 10000-row cap is still finite. Windows spanning years of high-activity production may hit it; warnings make this explicit and recommend narrowing the range.

---

### R16: LLM Judge Refusal Misread as Score

`score_factuality()` and `detect_hallucination()` used `re.search(r"\d+", text)` which matched any digit anywhere in the response. A Claude refusal like "I cannot rate this. 404 Not Found" parsed as 404 → clamped to 100 → "severe hallucination" alert on a refusal. "I can give you 7 reasons why not" parsed as 7 → factuality 7% → false drift.

- `app/services/llm_client.py::_parse_judge_score()` uses `re.fullmatch` — ONLY a bare integer (optionally whitespace or trailing decimals) counts as a score.
- Both judge functions now return `Optional[float]` — `None` when the judge refuses or returns non-numeric content.
- The eval harness flags such results as `status="judge_refused"` and EXCLUDES them from the aggregate quality score, so a flaky judge cannot spuriously trip drift on an otherwise-healthy service.

Residual: A consistently refusing judge would produce evals where most rows have no score. The aggregate quality stays stable, but the drift detector has less signal. Operators investigating repeated `judge_refused` should check the prompt or Claude's policy updates.

---

### R17: Rubber-Stamp Approval of LLM Drafts

A maintainer with a malicious agenda writes incident symptoms containing a prompt-injection payload. `generate_summary` produces a plausible-looking draft that contains fabricated claims. Admin skims, clicks Approve, and the fabricated content becomes the official incident record.

- `Incident.reviewer_note` column added. Approve endpoint requires a pydantic-validated note of at least 20 non-whitespace chars. Whitespace-only inputs are rejected at the router layer after `.strip()`.
- Double-approval returns HTTP 409 so attribution (`approved_by`, `approved_at`) is never silently overwritten by a racing admin.
- Frontend `IncidentDetailPage.handleApproveSummary` prompts for the note; backend rejects short notes even if the frontend is bypassed.

Residual: A determined admin who writes "looks fine lgtm approved moving on" passes the length check. The note's existence is a deterrent and an audit artifact, not a guarantee of careful review. Four-eyes approval (requires a second admin) would be the next step; tracked as a P2 item.
